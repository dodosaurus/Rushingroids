# Rushingroids
My first p5.js game attempt {and first steps with GitHub}

General aspects of this poor creation:
-> (indie like) space crawler, similar to Space Invaders

-> BASIC ENGINE: still faster and faster flowing asteroids against the spaceship, that has to go through without collision to get the higher score

-> PLANNED ADDONS: 
  - runtime interface, with Start and End or Reset game option, with Score counter
  - data structure to save best scores and nicknames added after scoring
  - nice pixel graphics for asteroids and the ship, generic background
  - implementing weapon system for spaceship, with limited ammo, to let it get from difficult situations
  - bonus tokens appearing getting some kind of new weaponary, or spaceship skin
  - levels based on real space locations, with rising difficulty
